# Contains test-specific settings like user private keys, test amounts, etc.
# This file should NOT be committed to the repository - copy to config.e2e-test.yaml
#
# Usage:
#   # Remote services (users must be pre-whitelisted)
#   go run scripts/e2e-test.go -config config.devnet.yaml -test-config config.e2e-test.yaml
#
#   # Local services with docker compose (auto-whitelists users)
#   go run scripts/e2e-test.go -config config.devnet.yaml -test-config config.e2e-test.yaml -local
#
#   # Local services already running (skip docker compose start)
#   go run scripts/e2e-test.go -config config.devnet.yaml -test-config config.e2e-test.yaml -local -skip-docker
